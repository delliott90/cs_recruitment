                    <div>The field of computer science is so broad and so vast that a detailed list would be almost impossible to make. Computer science is an ever-changing and growing field of work. New possibilities and new technology are a daily event. There are many preconceptions and myths about what a computer science graduate could work on, how they will work, and job availability. Letâ€™s look at the ten most common myths and frequently asked questions about computer science.</div>

                                The reality is that there are very few such solitary positions.
                                Computer science involves interaction with clients, managers, colleagues, and support
                                personnel. IT has many specializations: information management, customer service,
                                database and system programming, support staff and operations management. All of
                                these areas require some degree of interaction with others, and communication
                                skills are important. (1)

                                Computer science involves a great deal of math and problem solving. However, like any skill
                                you CAN get better through practice and hard work. Many high schools and universities
                                offer math tutoring to help you out.(4)

                                The first all-electronic, digital computer, the ENIAC, was programmed by six women. Grace Hopper,
                                a woman, invented the first programming language. Sanders, of the Center for Women and Information
                                Technology, believes it's all about diversity of thought and how diversity leads to a better product.

                                software development. Putting together a software system means thinking
                                creatively about the design, finding clever solutions to problems, exploiting
                                the best engineering practices, and maintaining a high-level vision of how all
