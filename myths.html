                    <div>The field of computer science is so broad and so vast that a detailed list would be almost impossible to make. Computer science is an ever-changing and growing field of work. New possibilities and new technology are a daily event. There are many preconceptions and myths about what a computer science graduate could work on, how they will work, and job availability. Let’s look at the ten most common myths and frequently asked questions about computer science.</div>

                <div class="content-box">The reality is that there are very few such solitary positions. Computer science involves problem solving, and problem solving involves interaction with others: clients, managers, colleagues, and support personnel. The field contains all kinds of specialization, areas to match many personality types, from the outgoing information management, customer service and support personnel to scientific database and system programming to support staff and operations management. All of these areas require some degree of interaction with others, and communication skills are important. A good resume can land a computer science graduate a particular job, but it is her communication skills that will determine how far she advances in her career.

                    Software development is also a highly creative activity. There is very little that is mechanical about software development, if there were, those aspects of the discipline would have been automated years ago. Putting together a software system means thinking creatively about the design, finding clever solutions to problems, exploiting the best engineering practices, and maintaining a high-level vision of how all the parts fit together.

                <div class="content-box">This myth appears to be entirely without foundation. Because of the enormous demand for people with strong information technology and computing skills, the opportunities for software engineers and other information technology professionals are expanding in Asia, just as they are everywhere else. The available evidence shows that even though some jobs are being moved offshore, the number of new computing jobs created in the United States is substantially higher. A recent report by the Association for Computing Machinery offers extensive background data and analysis of the effect of offshoring in the software industry. In a March 1, 2006 editorial, the New York Times observed that the real threat to the U.S. computing industry is not offshoring but the fact that so few students are getting the necessary training in the field: "The industry isn't gone, but it will be if we don't start generating the necessary dynamic work force".
